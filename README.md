# GraphIt

GraphIt is built using D3.js and by following @mbostock's tutorial for D3.js. It uses the tutorials to understand D3.js but abstracts the variables so they can be accessed and modified easily. This gives GraphIt the capability to easily graph your data.

## Usage
The general structure of GraphIt is to use a single function to create your graphs. For example, `barGraphIt("data.csv")`.  

The function requires only one parameter which is the location of your data. It also takes a second parameter that is a JSON object. Each graph may have its own available options for the second parameter and these are covered on each graph's page.  

For more details about GraphIt please check the [wiki](https://github.com/sbeleidy/GraphIt/wiki).

## Installation



## Features

GraphIt lets you easily create graphs to add to your site or web app by simply calling the *type* GraphIt() function, where *type* is the type of graph.

GraphIt gives you variables to customize your graph designs easily using SCSS.
